 * Description:
 *   This C program packs four individual char values into a single
 *   unsigned integer using bit shifting operations, then displays the
 *   resulting packed value in binary format with spaces separating
 *   each byte. The pack function demonstrates a condensed one-line
 *   approach to combining multiple bytes into a larger data type.
